## 👋 About the Creator

Hey — I'm **AIONIX**, a **17-year-old** builder who is obsessed with AI and machine learning.

I'm on a mission to prove that powerful tools shouldn't cost money. OpenClip is my first major open-source project — built not by a team, not by a funded startup, but by a teenager with a laptop, a vision, and a lot of caffeine.

> **This project is just getting started.** The roadmap is ambitious and the best features are still being built. If you believe in open-source AI tooling, now is the time to get involved — star the repo, fork it, or just stick around. 🚀

## ⭐ Support the Project

If OpenClip saves you time (or money on paid tools), please consider leaving a **star** on GitHub — it genuinely helps more people discover this project and motivates continued development.

**[⭐ Star this repo](https://github.com/aionix/openclip)** — it takes 2 seconds and means a lot.

## What is OpenClip?

OpenClip is a **free, open-source, local-first** alternative to paid video clipping tools like OpusClip, Vidyo.ai, and Munch.

- No subscriptions. No watermarks. No cloud uploads.
- Everything runs **on your machine**.
- Powered by AI for smart clip detection.
